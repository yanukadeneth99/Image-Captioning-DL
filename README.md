# 🧑‍🎨 Image Captioning Model

This project contains a tensorflow Jupyter Notebook project that you can use to build a Neural Network for Image Captioning.

## 🤔 How does it work?

You can download the project and run it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), easily with run buttons and it would work.
